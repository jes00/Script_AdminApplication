Admin-Application-Mod

=====================

The plan:

User submits admin application.
Server recieves it and a new text file is created of the application, in config/server/AdminApps/%BL_ID.txt.
Host pulls up application on GUI.
Host accepts/denies application.
User is notified and appropriate action is taken(to make them an admin or whatnot).
